# Urban Mobility Project
This projects uses the transportation network company (TNC) data released by the city of chicago to replicate a CMAP study on transportation. Large-scale computing techniques were applied to process 100+ million rows of data.

This study shows that economic status can significantly impact people's ride-hailing choices. The project also provides an overview of the demand of Uber/Lyft in different areas of the city.
